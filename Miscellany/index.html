Hackergame is a CTF game organized by USTC. The problem needs you to write a program running SHA-256 algorithm, but using <strong>only</strong> floating-point subtractions. 
After 2 nights and 3 days, unluckily I succesfully ran it just 2 hours after the end of the competition, losing the opportunity to be the only person in USTC 
who solved this problem in time.

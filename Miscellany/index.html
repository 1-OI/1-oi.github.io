Hackergame is a CTF game organized by USTC. The problem needs you to write a program running SHA-256 algorithm, but using <strong>only</strong> floating-point subtractions. You can not even use "if", "else", 
"while". The instruction set contains only two operations: "x", store a float number x, the address is the number of the instruction. "a b", store the #a-#b in float subtractions. Here a and b are the addresses of #a and #b, and again the address is the number of the instruction. The key point is that floating-point rounding can be served as the tool of logic gates. 
After 3 nights and 3 days, unfortunately I successfully ran it just 2 hours after the end of the competition, losing the opportunity to be the only person in USTC 
who solved this problem in time (sad).

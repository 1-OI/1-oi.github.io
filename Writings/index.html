All the writings may contain mistakes, but I am too lazy to fix them. 
<strong>WARNING: some early writings may be ill-written since I didn't know the writing standards at that time.</strong>

<li>
<A HREF="note.pdf"> pdf </A>
My solution for IMO 2024 Problem 6, sorted by my teacher Wang Xinmao who teaches linear algebra.

<A HREF="课上问题反例.pdf"> pdf </A>
Yang Jinbang had a course on representation theory at USTC in 2024 spring. In this course he gave two problems. I showed one problem is equivalent to the notorious
 Jacobi conjecture for the commutative case. The other problem, in contrast, is very easy to give such a counterexample even for local algebra.

<li>
<A HREF="IMO SL C5 short.pdf"> pdf </A>
A variation of IMO 2023 shortlist C5. I talked this problem with canbankan (Kai Wang, Duke University) at Beijing in 2024 summer. 
<br>

<li>
<A HREF="1.pdf"> pdf </A>
A brief review of Iwasawa lemma (group theory). I translated it from R.A. Wilson's book. 
<br>

<A HREF="Note Apr 7, 2025.pdf"> pdf </A>
(handwritten) A beatiful proof by Hu Ruicheng (Peking University). The problem is that, considering 2 integer sequences defined by
<center>
<em>a</em><sub>n+1</sub> = 2 <em>a</em><sub>n</sub> + 3 <em>b</em><sub>n</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>n+1</sub> = <em>a</em><sub>n</sub> + 2 <em>b</em><sub>n</sub>, <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> = 1, <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> = 0.
</center>
Then one find that <em>a</em><sub>n</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>n</sub> (up to sign) can give all possible integer solutions of the Pell equation:
<center>
<em>a</em><sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>-3<em>b</em><sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>=1.
</center>
In this note, he gives an elementary proof that the only <strong>square</strong> integer in {<em>a</em><sub>n</sub>} is 1. The proof uses a variation of Fermat's infinite descent method, introducing a third argument and doing the descent in a roundabout way.

<li>
<A HREF="ANT 1.pdf"> pdf </A>
Written in 2023, a solution for a problem in Tenenbaum's book on analytic number theory, which is about an application of the sieve method.
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="ANT 2.pdf"> pdf </A>
Written in 2024, a solution for a problem in Tenenbaum's book on analytic number theory, which is about the first step to prove an Erd&oumls' conjecture.
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="复习.pdf"> pdf </A>
Solution for a problem in ODE notes by Wang Dinghan (USTC, now at Princeton). I solved it for my midterm exam.
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="ELMO 2023 P6.pdf"> pdf </A>
My solution for ELMO 2023 Problem 6. (There is one story about it. I got the inspiration while bathing.) 
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="int.pdf"> pdf </A>
About the elementary representation of the primitive function. (first LaTeX document by myself, 2023)
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="ELMO 2022 P6.pdf"> pdf </A>
My solution for ELMO 2022 Problem 6.
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="IMO 2025 P3.pdf"> pdf </A>
My solution for IMO 2025 Problem 3.
<br> 

<li>
<A HREF="E6.pdf"> pdf </A>
The result of running Todd-Coxeter algorithm on E6, with respect to a subgroup generated by the digaram deleting one point from the Dynkin diagram. The 27 cosets may corresponds to the 27 lines on a cubic surface.

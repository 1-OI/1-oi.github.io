All the writings may contain mistakes, but I am too lazy to fix them.

<A HREF="note.pdf"> pdf </A>
My solution for the IMO 2024 Problem 6, sorted by my teacher Wang Xinmao who teaches linear algebra.

Yang Jinbang has a course on representation theory at USTC in 2024 spring. In this course he gave two problems. I showed one problem is the notorious
 Jacobi conjecture for the commutative case, another problem, in contrast, is very easy to give such a counterexample even for local algebra.

<A HREF="IMO SL C5 short.pdf"> pdf </A>
A variation of IMO 2023 shortlist C5. I talked this problem with canbankan (Kai Wang, Duke University) at Beijing in 2024 summer.

<A HREF="1.pdf"> pdf </A>
A brief review of Iwasawa lemma (group theory). I translated it from R.A. Wilson's book.

A beatiful proof by Hu Ruicheng (Peking University). The problem is that, considering 2 integer sequences defined by
<center>
<em>a</em><sub>n+1</sub> = 2<em>a</em><sub>n</sub> + 3 <em>b</em><sub>n</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>n+1</sub> = <em>a</em><sub>n</sub> + 2 <em>b</em><sub>n</sub>, <em>a</em><sub>0</sub>=1, <em>b</em><sub>0</sub>=0.
</center>
Then one find that <em>a</em><sub>n</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>n</sub> (up to sign) gives all possible the integer solutions of the Pell equation:
<center>
<em>a</em><sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>-3<em>b</em><sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>=1.
</center>
In this note, he gives an elementary proof that the only <strong>square</strong> integer in {<em>a</em><sub>n</sub>} is 1. The proof uses a variation of Fermat's infinite descent method, introducing a third argument and do the descent in a roundabout way.

Written in 2023, a solution for an exercise in Tenenbaum's book on analytic number theory.
